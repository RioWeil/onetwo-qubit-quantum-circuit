# Project Proposal - 1 & 2 Qubit Quantum Circuit Simulation

## What will the application do?
- The application will simulate a one/two qubit system and its evolution using quantum gates and measurement.

## Who will use it?
- Students who want to learn about the basics of how quantum computing works
- Educators, as a tool for teaching fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and computing.

## Why is this project of interest?
- I am doing a degree in math and physics, and quantum mechanics is one of my favourite fields.
- I want to combine my interests in QM and computation, and get more people interested in physics.
